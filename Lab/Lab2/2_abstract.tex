\begin{abstract}
	A doped silicon semiconductor wafer was analyzed to determine its electrical properties. 
	Using two different methods, it was determined that the semiconductor was a p-type.
	Its resistivity was found to be $\rho = 9\ \pm\ 2\ \Omega\ cm$.
	The carrier mobility of the semiconductor was  
	measured at 320 \pm 60 cm/V$\cdot$s, close to the accepted value of 455 cm/V$\cdot$s. The 
	carrier concentration was measured at 2.26 \times 10$^{15}$ \pm 9 \times 10$^{13}$  
	holes per cm$^{3}$, which is within the range of $10^{14}-10^{20}\ cm^{-1}$.
